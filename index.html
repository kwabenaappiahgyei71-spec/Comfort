    <h1>Dear Comfort</h1>

    <p>
      As the year is coming to an end, I have been doing a lot of reflection, and I felt it was important to reach out not to reopen anything, but to clear my heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know I said and did things in the past that hurt you, and for that, I am genuinely sorry. There is no excuse for it. I take responsibility for my words and actions, especially the times I spoke from anger or pride.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not want us to carry negative energy or unresolved feelings into a new year. If there is any place in your heart to forgive me, I would truly appreciate it. And if there is anything I need to forgive on my side as well, I do so freely.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am honestly glad you have moved on, and I wish you nothing but happiness and peace in your new relationship. I mean that sincerely.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am not trying to be anything more than what is appropriate, just someone who wishes you well. If you ever need help with anything and feel comfortable reaching out, you can, but there is absolutely no pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I just wanted to end the year on a note of peace and maturity. I wish you a beautiful new year ahead.
    </p>
